# mshenfield.dev

This is the source code for my resume/vanity project/spot to plop random crap down [mshenfield.dev](https://mshenfield.dev).
This is a site that is just POHTML and POJS and POCSS.  It shows in some spots, but it's refreshing to see how powerful
these foundational tools have become. 

## Running

The easiest way to develop is to clone this repository and point your browser directly at the main page using a `file://`
path (`file:///path/to/mshenfield.dev/index.html`).  Setting up a decent dev server that automatically invalidates
the browser's cache is still in the works.
